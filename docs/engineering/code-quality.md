# Code quality

Write code a strict senior engineer would approve on the first read. Two named foundations, treated as
**one spine** (they overlap ~80%, so don't juggle multiple vocabularies): **Robert C. Martin** (Clean
Code, SOLID, Clean Architecture) and **ArjanCodes** (cohesion/coupling, program-to-abstractions,
composition over inheritance, separate creation from use, data-first, simplicity/YAGNI). Apply as
judgment tools **only when you touch the code** — one focused change at a time, never a big-bang
refactor.

## Design (module / type level)

- **High cohesion, one reason to change** (SRP): a module/component/function does one job. If you can
  extract another well-named function, it was doing more than one thing.
- **Low coupling, depend on abstractions** (DIP): depend on interfaces/protocols, not concretions;
  inject external dependencies (clock, storage, logger, network) so they can be swapped and tested.
- **Open for extension, not modification** (OCP): adding a variant should touch a known, small set of
  places the compiler or type-checker can flag — never a scattered hunt. Reach for runtime registries
  only for genuinely open-ended, plugin-style extension points.
- **Composition over inheritance**; **separate creation from use** (build objects in one spot, use them
  elsewhere); **data-first** — a single in-memory source of truth, with UI and derived values computed
  from it.
- **Dependency rule / IO at the edges:** pure domain logic imports no UI, framework, or IO code; side
  effects (storage, clock, network, DOM) live in a thin outer ring. This is what makes the fast
  unit-test self-check possible.

## Clean code (unit level)

Intention-revealing names that encode the domain **and** unit where units exist (`widthInches`,
`isRetryEnabled`); booleans read as questions. Small functions that do one thing at one level of
abstraction, few params (group data clumps into typed objects). Queries return and don't mutate;
commands mutate and return nothing meaningful. One home per concept (**DRY**). Comments explain
**why**, not what — refactor confusing code instead of narrating it. Delete dead and commented-out
code; don't add generality for a hypothetical second case.

## Project-specific rules (these earn their place)

- **Domain rules import nothing from FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, or IO.** FIFO, cost split, settlement, and profit are plain functions over plain data. Enforce with a test that imports the domain package and asserts neither `fastapi` nor `sqlalchemy` landed in `sys.modules`.
- **Money is `int` cents, named `*_cents`.** Never `float` or `Decimal` for money. Enforced by pyright strict and the OpenAPI integer assertion in `acceptance.md`.
- **Validate at the API boundary with Pydantic; domain functions trust their inputs.** Don't re-validate inside the domain; raise domain errors (insufficient stock) and map them to HTTP responses once, in one place.
- **Every schema change ships an Alembic migration in the same PR.** No `create_all` outside tests.
- **Frontend API types are generated, never hand-written.** The generator script output is committed; `make check` fails if regenerating changes it. Editing the generated file by hand is forbidden; change the Pydantic schema instead.
- **TypeScript strict, no `any`, no non-null assertions.** Use the generated types and zod at form boundaries.
- **Server state lives in TanStack Query, not component state or context.** Invalidate the affected queries after a mutation instead of patching caches by hand.

## Smells to hunt (in self-review)

- **Universal:** long function, God component / large class, duplicated code, primitive obsession,
  long parameter list / data clumps, feature envy, shotgun surgery (one change touching many files →
  centralize the knowledge), message chains (walking `a.b.c.d` instead of asking the source of truth),
  unclear names, dead / speculative code.

- **React:** deriving state in an effect, prop drilling server data instead of querying where it is used, forms without a zod schema, `useEffect` fetching that TanStack Query should own.

## Testing

Unit-test the **pure logic** where it pays off — domain rules, conversions, serialization round-trips,
validation. The final acceptance doc remains the definition of done even when the tactical plan
changes. Verify UI and feel by running the app, not by building heavy component-test scaffolding. If
something is hard to test, that's a design smell — fix the coupling, don't test around it.
